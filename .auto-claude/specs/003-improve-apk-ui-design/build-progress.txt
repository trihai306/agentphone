Project: UI/UX Enhancement for Agent Portal Android App
Workspace: Managed by orchestrator
Started: 2025-12-25

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Feature-level enhancement focused on improving the existing UI/UX design. While no new functionality is being added, significant visual improvements and user experience refinements constitute a feature that enhances the product's professional quality and user satisfaction.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json with comprehensive subtask breakdown
- Phases: 6
- Total subtasks: 13
- Created init.sh for Android development environment setup
- Updated project_index.json with Android-specific configuration
- Updated context.json with discovered patterns and files

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Color Palette Enhancement): 1 subtask, no dependencies
  * Enhance accent colors and add gradient color variants

- Phase 2 (Theme and Component Styling): 3 subtasks, depends on Phase 1
  * Enhance typography system with better font weights
  * Polish button styles with enhanced states
  * Refine shape appearances for cards and components

- Phase 3 (Layout and Spacing Improvements): 3 subtasks, depends on Phase 2
  * Enhance hero section design
  * Refine status cards layout
  * Polish debug tools and connection info sections

- Phase 4 (Icon and Indicator Enhancement): 2 subtasks, depends on Phase 2, PARALLEL with Phase 3
  * Create animated status indicators
  * Enhance existing icons for consistency

- Phase 5 (Animations and Micro-interactions): 3 subtasks, depends on Phases 3 and 4
  * Implement smooth animations for status indicator transitions
  * Add loading states and animations for status refresh
  * Enhance button and switch interactions with micro-animations

- Phase 6 (Integration Testing and Polish): 1 subtask, depends on Phase 5
  * Build APK and verify on physical device

Services Involved:
- portal-apk (Android app): UI/UX enhancement target
  * Tech Stack: Kotlin, Android SDK, Material Design 3
  * Min SDK: 26 (Android 8.0)
  * Target SDK: 34 (Android 14)
  * Entry Point: MainActivity.kt

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 2
- Parallel groups:
  * Phases 3 (Layout Enhancement) and 4 (Iconography) can run concurrently
  * Both depend on Phase 2 and modify different file sets (layout XML vs drawable XML)
- Speedup estimate: 1.3x faster than sequential execution

Key Patterns Discovered:
- Color naming: Semantic naming with Material 3 tokens (accent_[color], accent_[color]_container)
- Theme structure: Material 3 Dark theme base with custom Widget.Portal.* component styles
- Card pattern: MaterialCardView with 20-24dp corner radius, 0dp elevation (flat design)
- View binding: Type-safe view access via ActivityMainBinding.inflate()
- Status indicators: 10dp oval shape drawables with semantic color references
- Vector icons: 24dp vector drawables with consistent stroke width, white fill for tintability
- Button styles: Widget.Portal.Button.* with 16-18dp corner radius, textAllCaps=false
- Typography: TextAppearance.Portal.* with clear size/weight hierarchy

Files to Modify:
- droidrun-controller/portal-apk/app/src/main/res/values/colors.xml
- droidrun-controller/portal-apk/app/src/main/res/values/themes.xml
- droidrun-controller/portal-apk/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml
- droidrun-controller/portal-apk/app/src/main/java/com/agent/portal/MainActivity.kt
- droidrun-controller/portal-apk/app/src/main/res/drawable/*.xml (status indicators and icons)

Verification Strategy:
- Risk Level: Low (UI-only changes, no functional modifications)
- Test Types: Unit tests (Gradle build verification, resource validation)
- Security Scanning: Not required
- Device Verification: Required on API 26, 30, and 34
- Visual Design Verification: Required (colors, typography, animations, spacing)

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 003 --parallel 2

This will launch 2 parallel workers to execute phases 3 and 4 concurrently for optimal speed.

=== ANDROID DEVELOPMENT NOTES ===

Build Commands:
  cd droidrun-controller/portal-apk
  ./gradlew assembleDebug
  adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
  adb shell am start -n com.agent.portal/.MainActivity

Required Tools:
  - Android SDK Platform Tools (adb)
  - Gradle 8.0+ (via wrapper)
  - JDK 11 or higher

Testing on Device:
  - Connect physical device via USB or start Android emulator
  - Enable USB debugging in Developer Options
  - Verify with: adb devices

Visual Verification:
  - Test on multiple screen sizes (320dp, 360dp, 600dp+)
  - Verify animations run at 60fps without frame drops
  - Check WCAG AA contrast ratios for all text
  - Ensure dark theme consistency across all components
