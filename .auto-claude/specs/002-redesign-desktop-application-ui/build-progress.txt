Project: Redesign Desktop Application UI
Workspace: managed by orchestrator
Started: 2025-12-24

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: This is a UI/UX enhancement task that involves modifying existing visual
components, adding new styling elements, and improving the overall user experience.
It follows a layered approach: foundation (theme) → components → views → integration.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 6
- Total subtasks: 17
- Created init.sh
- Updated project_index.json with service details
- Updated context.json with patterns and constraints

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Theme Enhancement): 1 subtask, no dependencies
- Phase 2 (Core Component Polish): 3 subtasks, depends on phase-1
- Phase 3 (Feedback Component Polish): 4 subtasks, depends on phase-1
- Phase 4 (Main Layout Polish): 1 subtask, depends on phase-2
- Phase 5 (View Polish): 7 subtasks, depends on phase-2 and phase-3
- Phase 6 (Integration & Verification): 2 subtasks, depends on phase-4 and phase-5

Services Involved:
- droidrun-controller: Flet-based Python desktop application for Android automation

Files to Modify (17 total):
Theme Layer:
  - app/theme.py

Component Layer (8 files):
  - app/components/card.py
  - app/components/action_button.py
  - app/components/status_badge.py
  - app/components/modal.py
  - app/components/toast.py
  - app/components/empty_state.py
  - app/components/loading.py
  - app/components/dashboard.py (if exists)

Layout Layer:
  - app/main.py

View Layer (7 files):
  - app/views/devices.py
  - app/views/agent_runner.py
  - app/views/workflows.py
  - app/views/executions.py
  - app/views/settings.py
  - app/views/analytics.py
  - app/views/phone_viewer.py

Patterns Identified:
- Theme constants: COLORS_LIGHT/COLORS_DARK dictionaries with semantic naming
- Component pattern: ft.Container inheritance with _on_hover handlers
- Animation pattern: ft.Animation(200, ft.AnimationCurve.EASE_OUT), scale 1.02
- Card styling: border_radius=20, padding=28, border with COLORS["border"]
- Icon containers: Colored background at 20% opacity (f"{color}20")

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 2
- Parallel groups:
  1. phase-2 and phase-3 (both depend only on phase-1, no file conflicts)
  2. phase-4 and phase-5 (different dependency chains, no file conflicts)
- Speedup estimate: 1.4x faster than sequential

Verification Strategy:
- Risk level: low (UI-only changes)
- Test types: unit tests only
- Security scanning: not required
- Minimal validation mode enabled

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue building this spec, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 002 --parallel 2

Alternative (manual development):

  cd droidrun-controller
  python run_app.py
